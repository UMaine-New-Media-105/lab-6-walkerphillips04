For this lab I struggled a lot with making the collison work at all. I tried multiple different ways to change the way the distance functions worked and I tried to set up how the sprite changes as well. With no luck. I am currently left with the main sprite's closed eyes in the top left corner of the screen and when the two sprites overlap each other they simply do not interact in anyway.  I am at a loss as to what I can do to make this work.  But atleast I have the main sprite be controlled with the arrow keys and the secondary sprite spawns at random places each time I run the program.
